A convenient script to test your server's speed that links to nodes in China

based on https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli

## Usage
no much things to explain  
cuz it's a script with Chinese language

just one thing... you must run it with `bash`  
like
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanqinlang/testspeed/master/testspeed.sh
bash testspeed.sh
```

it's the best to say nothing !
